# podbooking
Written in Python using Flask as a framework to deliver a web application for a more robust and updated interface for booking of network equipment.

A number of tables in a database using SQLITE and Flask/SQLAlchemy use the rough layout as follows:

(Rooms)
| id   |  name     |  pods |
|------|:---------:|------:|
| 1    |   b112    |   8   |
| 2    |   b114    |   6   |
| 3    |   b118    |   6   |
